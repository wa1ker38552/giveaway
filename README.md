# giveaway
Scrapes Twitters for giveaways. Uses Flask for backend and uses Twitter API to scrape posts that match the query 'giveaway'. The legitimacy score is assigned by taking the amount of followers and following a user has as well as the post statistics such as likes, dislikes, and retweets.

Note: The script cannot actually verify that the post is a giveaway, anything containing giveaway will be put through the filter!
